 # Overview 
 
**OT Compliance NERC CIP 002 Solution Pack: Ensuring Cybersecurity for Bulk Electric Systems**

The significance of the **OT Compliance NERC CIP 002** solution pack cannot be overstated, as it plays a pivotal role in determining the Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Asset Category and BES Cyber System Impact. This adherence is in strict accordance with the rigorous guidelines outlined in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) `002-5.1a` standard. The ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive and compliant approach to managing the cybersecurity aspects of the Bulk Electric System.

The **NERC CIP `002-5.1a`** standard serves a crucial purpose in identifying and categorizing BES Cyber Systems along with their associated BES Cyber Assets. This categorization is essential for applying cybersecurity requirements that aim to prevent the potential adverse impact that the loss, compromise, or incorrect operation of these BES Cyber Systems could have on the reliable operation of the BES.

The meticulous identification and categorization of BES Cyber Systems are integral to ensuring appropriate protection against compromises that might lead to malfunction or instability within the BES.
